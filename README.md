# Card-Game
G¨urb¨uz is a talented computer engineering student who loves to develop games. He invented a card
game, in which two players receive 3 hidden cards from cards at the beginning. There are 100 cards
and each card has a number between 1-100 written on it. A player does not know what cards the
other opponent received. The game starts after players receive their cards.
There will be 3 rounds. On each round, the players will pick a card among 3 cards that they received in the beginning. If a player has picked a card with value greater than the opponent’s choice,
then the player wins the round. Whoever wins 2 rounds out of 3 wins the game.
Nazlı is also another computer engineering student and heard about the game and found a serious bug. Now, she has the chance to interfere before she receives the last card from the game. She
can see all 5 cards that the game assigned until now and she can make the game assign whichever
card she wants as her last (third) card.
Nazlı wants to mock with G¨urb¨uz. She wants to win every time or wants to withdraw if she is
going to lose inevitably. How could she do this? Write an ITERATIVE solution for solving this
problem. The input has 5 cards between 1-100, first 3 cards are G¨urb¨uz’s cards and last 2 cards are
Nazlı’s cards. You need to find a card that makes Nazlı win the game no matter how badly
she plays. If there are multiple cards that guarantee a win for the game, print the card
with the minimum value. If there is no card that guarantees a win for the game, you
need to print “WITHDRAW”.
